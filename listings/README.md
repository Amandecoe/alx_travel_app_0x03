# ðŸ§³ ALX Travel App â€“ API Enhancement

This project enhances the **alx_travel_app** by implementing **API views** to manage **listings** and **bookings**.  
Youâ€™ll build fully functional **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** endpoints using **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and document them with **Swagger** for ease of access and testing.

The main focus is on applying **RESTful API design principles** while ensuring endpoints are **well-tested and reliable**.

---

## ðŸ“š Learning Objective

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Implement **ViewSets** in Django REST Framework to handle multiple model operations efficiently.
- Configure **API routes** using DRFâ€™s routers.
- Apply **RESTful conventions** in endpoint design ands .
- Document APIs with **Swagger** for interactive exploration.
- Test APIs with **Postman**/ Postman (or similar tools) to ensure correctness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

You will:

- Create and manage **CRUD endpoints** for multiple models in Django REST Framework.
- Integrate automatic **API documentation** with Swagger.
- Deploy **well-structured and tested API endpoints** that follow REST best practices.
- Test APIs for both **successful and error scenarios**.
